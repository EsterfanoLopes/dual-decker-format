# Dual Decker (DD, Commander DD, Oathbreaker DD, Standard DD, Pauper DD, ...)
Dual Decker is a casual Magic: The Gathering format where players use two separate decks: one with lands, and one without lands. The format can be played in combination with any other Magic format.

### Deckbuilding Rules
 - Each player must have two separate decks: one with at least 15 land cards of any type, and one with at least 15 non-land cards of any type.
 - All cards that are both a land and a non-land on the same card should be put in the deck corresponding to their original card type. For example, if a card is a land that its flip side is a creature, it should go to the land deck.
 - After sideboarding, the rule of minimum cards in each deck (15 cards in each) should not be ignored.

### Gameplay Rules
 - Each player must have two decks: one containing only land cards, and the other containing all non-land cards.
 - Players draw one hand, but they can choose from which deck they will draw each card.
 - Each turn, the player can draw a card as always, but they must choose which deck they will draw it from.
 - The minimum deck size is 15 cards.
 - When a player is instructed to mill cards, they must mill one card from each deck alternately.
 - When a player is instructed to reveal the top card of their library until a certain type of card appears, they must choose which deck to reveal cards from.
 - The ways to lose the game are the same as in other formats, except that a player must run out of cards in BOTH decks to lose the game.
 - If both players lose simultaneously (e.g. by losing all their remaining life points due to a card effect), the game is a draw.
 - All cards that are land and non-land on the same card should be placed in the deck corresponding to their original card type.
 - After sideboarding, the rule of minimum cards in each deck (15 cards in each) should not be ignored.
 
#### Additional Optional Rule
Use different sleeves to differentiate land and non-land cards. If using different sleeves for each deck, when a card asks a player to pick a card, they can roll a die to determine which card to pick.

### Banned Cards
There are no banned cards in the Dual Decker format at this time.

### Playing with Other Formats
Dual Decker can be played in combination with any other Magic format, including but not limited to Standard, Modern, Legacy, Commander, and others.
